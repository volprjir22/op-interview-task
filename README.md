Homework for interview

Write a function in python which, for a given input sentence (string x), returns a sentence where the words are written backwards.
Please do not use any advanced string manipulation functions, you can only access individual characters of the string like in an array (for example: x[5] means the 5th character of the string). The main objective of this exercise is to create the algorithm and you can use any procedural programming language (python is the best ;)) of your choice or even a pseudo-language.
Example of calling the function:
revert("The brown dog jumps in the meadows." -> "Eht nworb god spmuj ni eht swodaem."
